            q: 'What are the typical costs involved in a complete company name change?',
            a: 'Total costs typically range from ₹15,000-₹25,000 including government fees (₹1,500), professional charges for documentation and filing (₹10,000-₹15,000), and post-approval updates (₹3,000-₹8,000). Costs may vary based on company type, complexity, and additional services required. We provide transparent, fixed pricing with no hidden charges.'

            q: 'Can a company name change be cancelled or reversed after initiation?',
            a: 'The process can be withdrawn before shareholder approval, though incurred costs are non-recoverable. After EGM approval but before ROC filing, withdrawal requires board resolution. Once ROC processes the application, reversal becomes complex and may require a fresh name change process with all associated costs and procedures.'

        {
            q: 'How does a name change affect existing business relationships and contracts?',
            a: 'Existing contracts generally remain valid as the company\'s legal entity continues despite the name change. However, systematic notification to all stakeholders is essential, and some agreements may require amendments or addendums. We provide template communications and coordinate with legal teams for contract management during transition.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Are there any restrictions on how frequently a company can change its name?',
            a: 'While there\'s no specific legal limit on name change frequency, repeated changes may raise regulatory concerns and affect business credibility. Each change must follow the complete statutory process with associated costs and compliance requirements. We advise clients on optimal timing and strategic considerations for name changes.'

        {
            q: 'What happens to the company\'s digital presence and online assets during name change?',
            a: 'Digital assets including websites, social media accounts, domain names, and online registrations require systematic updates. Domain names should be secured with the new name, and redirects established from old domains. We provide guidance on digital transition strategies and can coordinate with branding agencies for comprehensive online presence management.'

        {
            q: 'How do name changes affect listed companies and their shareholders?',
            a: 'Listed companies have additional SEBI compliance requirements including board and shareholder approvals, disclosure obligations, stock exchange notifications, and investor communications. Trading symbols and ISIN codes may change, affecting investor portfolios. We provide specialized support for listed companies including SEBI compliance and market communication strategies.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Can companies in regulated industries like banking or insurance change names easily?',
            a: 'Regulated industries require additional approvals from sector regulators like RBI for banking, IRDAI for insurance, or SEBI for capital market intermediaries. These approvals involve detailed scrutiny and may have specific naming conventions. Our regulatory expertise helps navigate these complex requirements efficiently.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What ongoing compliance obligations arise after a successful name change?',
            a: 'Post-name change compliance includes maintaining updated statutory registers, filing future returns with the new name, ensuring all regulatory correspondence reflects the change, and monitoring for any name-related disputes or conflicts. We provide ongoing compliance monitoring and annual filing support to maintain good standing with all authorities.'
