                        'Design registration legally protects the unique visual features (shape, configuration, pattern, ornament, or composition of lines or colors) applied to an article, making it stand out in the market. In India, the Designs Act, 2000 grants exclusive rights to the registered proprietor to use, license, or stop unauthorized copying of the design. This registration applies to industrial or product designs but does not cover functional features, trademarks, or artistic works protected by copyright.',
                        'Design registration is crucial for product-based businesses as it protects the aesthetic and visual appeal that often drives consumer choice. Unlike patents that protect functionality, design registration safeguards the ornamental aspects that make products visually distinctive and commercially attractive.',

                        'Design protection is territorial and must be filed in each country where protection is sought. However, international frameworks like the Hague Agreement facilitate multi-jurisdictional filing and provide a streamlined process for global design protection.'

            q: 'What kinds of products and designs are eligible for registration in India?',
            a: 'Any industrial product with new and original visual features including shape, pattern, configuration, or ornamentation is eligible. This covers consumer electronics, automotive parts, packaging, furniture, fashion accessories, machinery components, and virtually any manufactured product with distinctive aesthetic appeal.

            q: 'Is it necessary to register a design before launching a product commercially?',
            a: 'While not legally mandatory, registration before commercial launch is strongly recommended to secure exclusive rights and prevent copying. Once a design is publicly disclosed through sale, exhibition, or publication, it loses novelty and becomes ineligible for registration. Early filing ensures maximum protection and commercial advantage.'

        {
            q: 'Can I register a design that has been disclosed to the public previously?',
            a: 'No, novelty is absolutely essential for design registration. Any public disclosure including sale, exhibition, publication, or online display before filing destroys novelty and makes the design ineligible. Limited disclosure under confidentiality agreements may be permissible, but public availability creates absolute bar to registration.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What documents and materials are required for filing a design application?',
            a: 'Essential requirements include high-quality drawings or photographs from multiple angles, completed Form-1 application, statement of novelty, applicant identification documents, Power of Attorney (if using agent), and government fees. Priority documents needed if claiming foreign priority. We provide comprehensive checklists and handle all documentation requirements.'

        {
            q: 'Can I renew my design registration and extend protection beyond 10 years?',
            a: 'Yes, design registration can be renewed once for an additional 5 years, providing total protection of 15 years maximum. Renewal application must be filed before the 10-year expiry with prescribed fees. After 15 years, the design enters public domain and cannot be re-registered or further extended.'

            q: 'How does design registration differ from patent and trademark protection?',

        {
            q: 'Can I file for international design protection based on my Indian application?',
            a: 'Yes, Indian design registration provides 6-month priority for filing in other countries. We coordinate international filing strategies through various treaty systems including Hague Agreement, ensuring cost-effective global protection in commercially important markets while maintaining priority benefits.'
        },
        {

            a: 'Rejections can often be overcome through proper responses addressing Controller\'s concerns.
