                        'An Insurance Web Aggregator is a company or LLP authorized by IRDAI to maintain a digital platform (website or app) for displaying, comparing, and selling insurance products of multiple insurers. The aggregator acts as a neutral, tech-driven intermediary and must comply with IRDAI\'s stringent regulatory, IT, and fair practice norms. Web aggregators play a key role in driving customer choice, transparency, and digital adoption in insurance.',
                        'These platforms serve as digital marketplaces where consumers can access comprehensive information about various insurance products from different insurers in one consolidated location. The aggregator model promotes competitive pricing, enhanced product transparency, and improved customer experience through simplified comparison tools and streamlined purchase processes.',
                        'Web aggregators are required to maintain strict neutrality in product presentation, ensuring that no single insurer receives preferential treatment in terms of placement, highlighting, or promotional activities. This regulatory requirement ensures fair competition and protects consumer interests by providing unbiased product information.',
                        'The IRDAI framework for web aggregators emphasizes technology-driven solutions that enhance insurance accessibility, particularly in underserved markets and among digitally-savvy consumers who prefer online research and purchase processes.'
