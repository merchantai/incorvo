                        'An Insurance Broker License is a comprehensive regulatory authorization granted by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) enabling qualified entities to operate as professional intermediaries in the insurance marketplace. Licensed brokers serve as independent advisors and facilitators, connecting insurance seekers with appropriate insurance products while maintaining fiduciary responsibility to their clients rather than insurance companies.',
                        'The insurance broking framework in India has evolved significantly since liberalization, transforming from a traditional agent-based model to a sophisticated professional services industry. Brokers play a crucial role in the insurance ecosystem by providing expert advice, risk assessment, policy comparison, claims assistance, and ongoing portfolio management services to individual and corporate clients across diverse industry sectors.',
                        'Licensed insurance brokers operate under strict regulatory oversight, ensuring high standards of professional conduct, financial integrity, and client protection. The licensing framework establishes clear categories of broking activities, capital requirements, governance standards, and ongoing compliance obligations that maintain market confidence and consumer trust in the broking profession.',
                        'The regulatory framework recognizes insurance broking as a specialized financial service requiring technical expertise, market knowledge, and professional accountability. Licensed brokers can access multiple insurance companies\' products, negotiate terms on behalf of clients, provide independent advice free from product bias, and maintain long-term client relationships built on trust, expertise, and fiduciary responsibility.'
