    faqs: [
        {
            q: 'What is event-based compliance and how does it differ from annual statutory compliance?',
            a: 'Event-based compliance is triggered by specific corporate events or changes (director appointments, capital alterations, office changes) requiring immediate statutory filings, unlike annual compliance which is periodic. These events require specific forms, approvals, and documentation within prescribed timelines, typically 15-30 days from the triggering event.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What are the consequences of filing event-based forms after the prescribed deadline?',
            a: 'Late filing attracts daily penalties of ₹100 per form with no upper limit, plus additional penalties up to ₹5 lakh for serious defaults. More critically, delays can invalidate corporate actions, block future filings, and result in prosecution of company and officers for willful default.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Is professional certification mandatory for all event-based statutory filings?',
            a: 'Most event-based forms require professional certification or attestation from qualified Company Secretary or Chartered Accountant, especially for capital changes, constitutional amendments, and director appointments. The level of certification depends on the form type and complexity of the event.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Can multiple related events be processed and filed together for efficiency?',
            a: 'Yes, related events can be bundled and processed together, but each event must have proper individual documentation, approvals, and compliance with specific requirements. This approach often reduces costs and ensures coordinated compliance while maintaining regulatory accuracy.'
        },
        {
            q: 'How must changes be communicated to external stakeholders after ROC approval?',
            a: 'After ROC approval, changes must be systematically communicated to all relevant stakeholders including banks (for account updates), GST authorities (for registration changes), regulatory bodies, business partners, and vendors. This ensures operational continuity and legal validity across all relationships.'
        },

        },
        {
            q: 'What are the specific penalties for unreported director appointments or resignations?',
            a: 'Unreported director changes attract daily penalties plus potential prosecution under Section 447 of Companies Act. More seriously, unreported appointments may be invalid, affecting board decisions, while unreported resignations can create liability issues. Companies may face fines and officers risk imprisonment for willful defaults.'

        {
            q: 'What statutory registers and records must be updated after event-based filing completion?',
            a: 'All relevant statutory registers must be updated including Register of Members, Register of Directors, Register of Charges, Minutes Books, and company database. Share certificates may need reissuance, and constitutional documents updated. Failure to update records can invalidate the compliance effort and attract separate penalties.'
