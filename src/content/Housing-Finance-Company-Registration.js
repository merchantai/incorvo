HFCs operate as crucial intermediaries in the housing finance ecosystem, bridging the gap between capital markets and individual homebuyers while promoting homeownership and real estate development across India.',
                        'These institutions are dual-regulated entities, supervised by both the National Housing Bank (NHB) as the primary regulator and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for certain policy matters, ensuring robust oversight and consumer protection. The regulatory framework ensures that HFCs maintain high standards of governance, risk management, and customer service while contributing to the national goal of housing for all.',
                        'HFCs serve as vital contributors to India\'s housing finance sector, providing specialized products and services that cater to diverse segments of homebuyers, from first-time purchasers to high-net-worth individuals. Their expertise in housing finance, combined with local market knowledge and customer-centric approaches, makes them essential players in achieving India\'s ambitious housing and urban development goals.',
                        'The business model of HFCs revolves around mobilizing funds from various sources including public deposits, institutional borrowings, and capital markets, and efficiently deploying these resources to provide housing loans, construction finance, and related financial services. This specialized focus enables them to develop deep expertise in real estate valuation, legal documentation, and risk assessment specific to the housing sector.'
