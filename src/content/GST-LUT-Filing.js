                        'A Letter of Undertaking (LUT) under GST is a comprehensive declaration filed by registered exporters and eligible service providers to facilitate the export of goods or services without the payment of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST). This mechanism enables businesses to treat their exports as zero-rated supplies, eliminating the need for upfront tax payment and subsequent refund claims.',
                        'The LUT system represents a significant improvement over the previous export regime, providing immediate cash flow benefits and reducing the administrative burden associated with refund procedures. By filing an LUT, exporters can issue invoices without charging IGST, thereby making their products more competitive in international markets while preserving working capital for business operations.',
                        'Under the GST framework, the LUT is filed online through the official GST portal and remains valid for the entire financial year from April to March. This annual validity ensures continuous export operations without interruption, provided all compliance requirements are met and the undertaking conditions are fulfilled throughout the period.',
                        'The LUT mechanism is particularly beneficial for service exporters, IT companies, software developers, consultants, and manufacturing exporters who need to maintain competitive pricing and efficient cash flow management in international markets. Without an LUT, exporters would be required to pay IGST on export invoices and later claim refunds, resulting in significant delays, working capital blockage, and increased compliance burdens.'
