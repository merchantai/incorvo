ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards ensure that a company\'s products, services, and processes meet global benchmarks for efficiency, safety, and reliability.',
                        'The International Organization for Standardization, established in 1947, represents the world\'s largest developer of voluntary international standards. These standards provide a framework for organizations to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their management systems in various operational areas.',

This certification provides stakeholders, customers, and regulatory bodies with confidence in the organization\'s ability to consistently deliver quality products and services.',
