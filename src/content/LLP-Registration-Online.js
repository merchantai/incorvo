                        'A Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) is a modern business structure that combines the operational flexibility of a partnership with the limited liability protection of a company. Introduced under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, LLPs are recognized as separate legal entities, distinct from their partners. They offer protection to personal assets, ensure perpetual succession, and have minimal compliance requirements compared to companies, making them ideal for startups, professionals, SMEs, and family-run businesses.',
                        'LLPs in India must have at least two designated partners (at least one resident in India) and can have unlimited partners. There is no minimum capital requirement, and the LLP agreement governs the rights and duties among partners.'
