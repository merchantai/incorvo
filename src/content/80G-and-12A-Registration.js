This applies to schools, colleges, universities, research institutions, and skill development centers. However, the institution must demonstrate that it operates exclusively for charitable purposes (advancement of education) and does not distribute profits to any individual. Commercial educational institutions primarily focused on profit-making are not eligible for these registrations.'

            q: 'What is the timeline to file Form 10BD and what are the consequences of missing it?',
            a: 'Form 10BD must be filed by 31st May of the assessment year immediately following the financial year in which donations were received. For example, donations received in FY 2023-24 must be reported by 31st May 2024. Missing this deadline can result in late fees, penalties under Section 271AA, and in severe cases, cancellation of 80G registration. It can also affect donors\' ability to claim deductions if the organization fails to report their donations properly.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Is it possible to file a revision for Form 10BD if errors are discovered?',
            a: 'Yes, a revised Form 10BD can be filed before the original deadline (31st May) in case of errors, omissions, or additional information. However, once the deadline passes, revision becomes more complicated and may require specific circumstances and departmental approval. Organizations should implement proper donor tracking systems and conduct thorough reviews before filing to minimize the need for revisions. It\'s advisable to maintain backup records and conduct internal audits before submission.'

        {
            q: 'Can donors verify the validity of an organization\'s 80G certificate online?',
            a: 'Yes, donors can verify the 80G approval status and validity on the Income Tax e-filing portal using the organization\'s PAN. This verification system allows donors to confirm that their intended donation will be eligible for tax deduction benefits. Donors should always verify before making significant donations, as contributing to organizations with expired or invalid 80G certificates will not provide any tax benefits. The portal shows the registration status, validity period, and applicable deduction percentage.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Are CSR-funded donations eligible for 80G deductions?',
            a: 'No, CSR contributions made by companies under Section 135 of the Companies Act are specifically excluded from 80G deductions as per Section 80G(2)(iiih) of the Income Tax Act. This means companies cannot claim 80G deductions on their CSR spending. However, the recipient organization must still be 12A registered to receive CSR funds, and individual donors (not companies) making personal donations to the same organization can still claim 80G benefits on their personal contributions.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What are the implications if 80G registration expires?',
            a: 'If 80G registration expires without renewal, several consequences follow: donors cannot claim deductions on contributions made after expiry, the organization loses a major fundraising advantage, funding from donors may decrease significantly, and retrospective renewal is not possible - only fresh application. Organizations should apply for renewal at least 6 months before expiry. The renewal process requires comprehensive documentation of activities and compliance for the preceding period, making early application crucial for seamless continuation.'
        },
        {
            q: 'How frequently should Form 10BE certificates be issued to donors?',
            a: 'Form 10BE certificates should be issued annually to every donor whose donations have been reported in Form 10BD for that financial year. However, many organizations issue these certificates immediately after receiving donations to help donors with their tax planning. The certificate must contain specific details including donor PAN, donation amount, date, eligible deduction percentage, and organization\'s registration details. Multiple donations from the same donor in a year can be consolidated into one annual certificate.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Is 12A/80G registration a substitute for FCRA registration?',
            a: 'No, 12A/80G and FCRA are completely different registrations serving different purposes. 12A/80G provides domestic tax exemption benefits under the Income Tax Act, while FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) registration is mandatory to accept foreign contributions under the Ministry of Home Affairs. Organizations receiving both domestic and foreign funds need both registrations. Many funding agencies require both FCRA and 12A/80G compliance, making both registrations essential for comprehensive fundraising capability.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Can private foundations and family trusts apply for 80G registration?',
            a: 'Yes, private foundations can apply for 80G registration provided their governance structure is transparent, activities serve the general public rather than specific families or groups, and operations align with charitable objectives as defined under the Income Tax Act. However, family trusts primarily benefiting specific family members are generally not eligible. The key criterion is whether the organization serves public charitable purposes rather than private interests, regardless of its founding or funding source.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What is the difference between 50% and 100% deduction under 80G?',
            a: 'The deduction percentage depends on the type of organization and approval granted. 100% deduction is typically available for contributions to government funds, approved research institutions, and certain specified organizations. 50% deduction applies to most charitable organizations including NGOs, trusts, and societies. Additionally, some organizations have deduction limits (subject to 10% of gross total income) while others don\'t. The specific percentage and conditions are mentioned in the organization\'s 80G certificate and should be clearly communicated to donors.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Can an organization lose its 12A/80G registration retroactively?',
            a: 'Yes, if serious violations are discovered, registrations can be cancelled retroactively, meaning the cancellation can apply from a past date. This results in the organization becoming liable to pay income tax on previously exempt income and donors losing claimed deductions. Common reasons for retroactive cancellation include misuse of funds, activities contrary to charitable purposes, or providing false information during registration. This makes ongoing compliance and transparent operations crucial for maintaining registration validity.'
        },
        {
            q: 'How does the 5-year validity period work for registrations obtained after April 2021?',
            a: 'All 12A and 80G registrations granted after April 1, 2021, are valid for exactly 5 years from the date of approval and require renewal before expiry. Organizations must apply for renewal using Form 10AB at least 6 months before expiry. The renewal process involves comprehensive review of activities, compliance, and financial management during the 5-year period. Failure to renew on time results in automatic expiry, requiring fresh application rather than simple renewal.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What audit requirements apply to organizations with 12A/80G registration?',
            a: 'Organizations with total income (including donations) exceeding ₹25 lakhs in a financial year must get their accounts audited by a qualified chartered accountant and file audited financial statements with their ITR-7. Smaller organizations can self-certify their accounts but should maintain proper books of accounts. Additionally, many funding agencies and government schemes require audited accounts regardless of income levels, making professional auditing advisable for most registered organizations.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Can an organization apply for 80G without having 12A registration?',
            a: 'While not legally mandatory, most organizations find it practical to obtain 12A registration before or simultaneously with 80G application. 12A provides tax exemption to the organization itself, while 80G benefits donors. Having 12A demonstrates the organization\'s commitment to charitable purposes and compliance with tax regulations, which strengthens the 80G application. Some funding sources also require both registrations, making it strategically important to have both certifications.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What happens to existing donors when an organization\'s registration is cancelled?',
            a: 'When registration is cancelled, donors who claimed deductions on contributions to the organization may lose those benefits retrospectively, depending on the effective date of cancellation. The Income Tax Department may recover taxes on previously claimed deductions along with interest and penalties. Current donors should be immediately informed about cancellation so they can make alternative donation arrangements. This highlights the importance for donors to verify organization credentials before making contributions.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Are there any restrictions on how organizations can use 80G/12A certified funds?',
            a: 'Yes, funds must be used exclusively for charitable purposes as stated in the organization\'s objectives and registration certificate. At least 85% of income should be applied for charitable purposes in the year of receipt, with the remaining 15% potentially accumulated for future use (subject to Section 11(2) provisions). Organizations cannot use these funds for personal benefit of trustees/directors, political activities, commercial ventures beyond permitted limits, or any purpose that violates Section 13 conditions. Proper documentation of fund utilization is essential for compliance.'
        },
        {
            q: 'How can organizations effectively communicate their 80G benefits to potential donors?',
            a: 'Organizations should clearly mention their 80G registration number, validity period, and applicable deduction percentage on all fundraising materials, websites, and donation receipts. Create simple tax benefit calculators showing potential savings for donors at different income levels. Issue Form 10BE certificates promptly and provide guidance on how donors can claim deductions. Include testimonials from existing donors about the tax benefits they\'ve received. Regular communication about registration status and compliance helps build donor confidence and trust.'
        },
        {
            q: 'What role does the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) play in the registration process?',
            a: 'The Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions) is the approving authority for both 12A and 80G registrations. They review applications, conduct or order field verifications, issue notices for additional information, and make final decisions on approval or rejection. The Commissioner also handles renewal applications, compliance monitoring, and cancellation proceedings. Organizations can approach the Commissioner for clarifications on compliance issues and must respond promptly to any notices or queries from this office to ensure smooth processing of applications.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Can organizations operate in multiple states with a single 12A/80G registration?',
            a: 'Yes, 12A and 80G registrations are valid throughout India and allow organizations to operate in multiple states. However, organizations must comply with local regulations in each state where they operate, including state-specific registrations under Societies/Trust Acts, GST registration in states where applicable, and compliance with local labor and other regulatory requirements. The income tax registration remains centralized, but operational compliance may vary by state. Organizations should maintain proper records of interstate activities for compliance purposes.'
