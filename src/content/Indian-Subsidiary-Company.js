                        'An Indian subsidiary company is a distinct legal entity incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013, where a foreign corporate entity, individual, or group of investors holds more than 50% of the share capital and exercises control over the board of directors and strategic business decisions. This structure creates a separate Indian company that operates as an independent legal person while being strategically controlled by its foreign parent company.',
                        'The subsidiary model represents one of the most popular and effective mechanisms for foreign direct investment in India, offering a perfect balance between local presence and foreign control. Unlike branch offices or liaison offices, subsidiaries enjoy full operational autonomy, can engage in all permissible business activities, and provide complete limited liability protection to the parent company and its shareholders.',
                        'Under Indian corporate law, subsidiaries are treated as Indian companies for all legal, regulatory, and operational purposes, enabling them to participate fully in the Indian economy while benefiting from foreign expertise, capital, and global market access. This dual identity creates unique advantages in terms of local market penetration, regulatory compliance, and business development opportunities.',
                        'The Indian subsidiary framework has been continuously liberalized to attract foreign investment, with most sectors now permitting 100% foreign ownership under the automatic route. This policy environment, combined with India\'s robust legal framework, skilled workforce, and growing market opportunities, makes subsidiary registration an attractive option for global businesses seeking sustainable growth in one of the world\'s largest and fastest-growing economies.'
