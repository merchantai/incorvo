                        'Copyright registration is the legal process of securing exclusive rights for creators over their original works of authorship, such as books, music, art, films, software, and more. In India, the Copyright Act, 1957 protects such works and allows the copyright holder to reproduce, publish, distribute, perform, or license their creation. Registration is not mandatory, but it provides prima facie legal evidence of ownership and simplifies enforcement in case of infringement.',
                        'Copyright protection arises automatically upon creation of an original work, but registration creates a public record and legal presumption of ownership. This distinction is crucial for creators seeking to monetize their works or protect them from unauthorized use.',
                        'Incorvo offers end-to-end solutions for copyright registration, from paperwork to follow-ups, ensuring your creative assets are protected and legally recognized with comprehensive support throughout the process.'

                        'Moral rights, which are inalienable, include the right of paternity (attribution) and integrity (preventing distortion or mutilation). Economic rights can be assigned or licensed, making copyright a valuable commercial asset for creators and businesses.'

            a: 'No, copyright protection arises automatically upon creation of original work.

Registration significantly strengthens your legal position in infringement cases and licensing negotiations.'
